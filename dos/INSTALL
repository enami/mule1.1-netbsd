Demacs installation procedure.

By default, the compilation parameters is setted to cross-compileing
environment on some UNIX machine with GCC 2.1 (You can change this by
editing latter lines in `src/s-msdos3.h').  If you have such
environment, you can construct `src/temacs' with:
	% make temacs

Before putting lisp stuff to DOS machines, I recommend to
byte-recompile them on UNIX.  And then put `src/temacs', `etc/DOC' and
lisp stuff to DOS machine and dump `demacs' like:
	C> go32 temacs -batch -l loadup dump
