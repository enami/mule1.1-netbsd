1. SETTING FONT PATH

To run Mule as a client of X, X's font is required for each
character set (e.g. GB2312 [Chinese], JISX0208 [Japanese]).
The fonts you can use on your X server are listed by the
command 'xlsfonts'.
	% xlsfonts | egrep -i gb2312
will show you fonts for Chinese (GB).
	% xlsfonts | egrep -i jisx0208
will show you fonts for Japanese.
	% xlsfonts | egrep -i ksc5601
will show you fonts for Korean.
	% xlsfonts | egrep -i big5
will show you fonts for Big5.

If you can't find necessary fonts, check your 'Font Path' by:
	% xset q
Under the default setting of X.V11R5, fonts for Japanese and
Korean are in the directory /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc.  If
these directories are not in your Font Path, put them in by:
	% xset fp+ /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc
If there are no such directories, you must create X's font
from BDF files by yourself  (See BUILDING FONT).

Now, you can run Mule on X.  If you want to use different
fonts than defaults, you can specify them by command line
switch or your X's resource file (try 'man mule' or look
into the file 'mule/etc/mule.1').

2. BUILDING FONTS

X.V11R5 is distributed with many fonts (BDF format).  Those
are under X.V11R5/mit/fonts/bdf/misc:
	jiskan16.bdf, jiskan24.bdf (Japanese)
	hanglm16.bdf, hanglm24.bdf (Korean)
and under X.V11R5/contrib/clients/cxterm/fonts:
	cclib16st.bdf, cclib24st.bdf (Chinese GB)
	hku-ch16.bdf (Chinese Big5)
To create fonts from these files, you'd better make a
directory for them (say ${font}):
	% mkdir ${font}
	% cd ${font}
	% bdftopcf xxx/jiskan24.bdf >jiskan24.pcf
	% bdftopcf yyy/hanglm24.bdf >hanglm24.pcf
	...
	% mkfontdir
	% xset fp+ `pwd`
Now you can check if you are really able to use these fonts by
'xlsfonts' command.  You must use 'bdftosnf' instead of
'bdftopcf' if you are using X.V11R4.

3. ADDITIONAL FONTS

Mule requires more fonts than in the distribution of
X.V11R5.  For instance, in the case of using EGG with cWnn's
cserver, font for SiSheng characters is necessary.  The
directory 'fonts' under the ftp directory of Mule contains
those fonts.


4. MULE'S FONT SELECTION MECHANISM

There are many ways to specify which font to be used for
a certain character set.

  (1) By calling the function 'set-x-default-font'
	In lisp/mule-init.el, most of fonts are given
	default values by calling this function.  You can
	change or add values by calling it in site-init.el.
	You can call it in your .emacs for fonts except for
	ASCII.  Here's the document of 'set-x-default-font'
	------------------------------------------------------------
	set-x-default-font:
	Set FONTNAME (2nd arg) and ENCODING (3rd arg) as a default
	for the character set LEADING-CHAR (1st arg).
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Example in mule-init.el:
	(set-x-default-font
	  lc-thai "-*-fixed-medium-r-*--*-*-*-*-*-*-tis620.2529-1" 1)

  (2) By specifying fonts in X's resource database
	Please read man file of Mule (etc/mule.1).
	Example in my ~/.Xresources:
	*FontJP:		-*-fixed-medium-r-*--*-*-jisx0208.1983-*
	*FontLTN1:		-ETL-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--*-*-ISO8859-1

  (3) By specifying fonts in command line argument of Mule
	Please read man file of Mule (etc/mule.1).
	Example:
	% mule -fn a14 -fnjp k14

  (4) By calling the function 'x-set-font'
	This is the only way to change font dynamically.
	Here's the document of 'x-set-font'.  Please note
	that it is extended from the original of GNU Emacs.
	You can not use it while dumping (creating) Mule.
	------------------------------------------------------------
	x-set-font:
	Sets the font to be used for the X window.
	When called from a program, expects three arguments,
	 FONTNAME, LEADING-CHAR (0 or 0x81..0xFF), and ENCODING (0 or 1).
	LEADING-CHAR and ENCODING default to 0.
	Return t if the fonts is loaded successfully, else return nil.
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Example:
	ESC ESC (x-set-font "k14" lc-jp 0)<CR>

The priorities are: (1) < (2) < (3) < (4)

Use 'x-get-fontinfo' to know which font is loaded.
------------------------------------------------------------
x-get-fontinfo:
Return font information for the character set LEADING-CHAR
by a list of:
  REQUESTED-NAME: Fontname specified for openining font.
  OPENED-NAME: Fontname of the font actually opened.
  OPENED: t if the font has already opened, else nil.
------------------------------------------------------------
If OPENED-NAME is nil and OPENED is t, ASCII font is being
used instead of REQUESTED-NAME.
