#        Syntax and Category of character		   #
############################################################

1. syntax

Mule can define syntax of all multi-byte characters by
modify-syntax-entry.

The first of modify-syntax-entry should be one of below:
  (1) ASCII character
  (2) multi-byte character
  (3) leading character of multi-byte character
  (4) (leading character << 8) | (first byte of multi-byte character)

There's a restriction of specifying matching character within 
second argument.  If the first argument specifies multi-byte
character or leading char of multi-byte character, the
matching character should have the same leading character.  If
the character is 2-byte code, the first-byte of it should
also be the same with the first-byte of first argument.

2. category

Like syntax, category also defines characteristics of
characters.  The difference is:
  (1) Each Character can have more than one category.
  (2) User can define new type of category as he wishes.
	Example: See japanese.el
  (3) char-category returns all mnemonics of the character
	by string.
  (4) For regular expression search, you can use the \cm or
	\Cm (any mnemonics comes at the place of 'm')
	instead of \sm and \Sm.
