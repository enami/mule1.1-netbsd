Quail is a simple key-translation system which allows users
to input any multilingual text from normal ASCII keyboard.

We provide several quail-packages, each package corresponds
to one inputting methods.  For instance, the file
lisp/quail-py.el provides a package for inputting Chinese by
PinYin.  lisp/quail-hangul.el provides a package for
inputting Korean.

You can load several packages at once but only the
translation rules defined in the current package are
effective.  Quail-mode is toggled by C-].  When you enter in
quail-mode, the current package is shown in modeline as:
	Q-xxxxx
where xxxxx is the multilingual text for the current
package.  In quail-mode, M-s changes the current package
(normal completion is performed by hitting <SPC> or <TAB>).

In quail-mode, all graphic keys you type is translated
according to the rules of the current package.  Brief
description about the rules and key-bindings are shown by
M-z.

While there are more than one candidates for what you type,
the first candidate is shown in buffer with underscore.  By
M-n and M-p you can select any other candidate.  M-i shows
list of candidates (showing each candidate with index number
[two digits]).  You can select one also by typing these
digits.

Once you select a desired candidate, please just type a key
for another character.  The underscore moves to the next key
automatically.  But, in some packages (e.g. quail-hangul),
there are rules something like:
	ab  -> A
	aba -> B
	b   -> C
In this case, if you type "abab", quail will enter "BC".  If
what you want is "AA", you must explicitly tell the division
point of the character by hitting <SPC>.  In this example,
you should have typed "ab<SPC>ab".

Here's the summary of command keys:

DEL:	Delete characters backward in quail-mode.
M-i:	Show list of candidates.
